# MovieViewer

This is a simple Angular4 application, created to showcase a simple workflow of retrieving data from the remote API, display it in a app, constructed from several components, service and single filtering pipe.
All scripts are covered with specs, covering both implementation and DOM rendering.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

To start, simply run npm install and after that follow general Angular CLI instructions (ng serve/ test).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma]
